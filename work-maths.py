# Machines are good at crunching numbers -
# faster and more accurately than most humans!
# Create a small program that calculates
# something useful to you (making you smile
# is useful). It should take user input, at
# use at least one of the number operators we
# saw in class: + / * -. You may modify one
# of your previous exercises to include
# calculations, if you wish.
